# Rust-L-System
A recreation of my python implementation of an L-System.

That code bar up there makes it look like it's a Python project with some Rust thrown into the mix.  That's just because the Rust turtle libraries are practically nonexistent.  I didn't actually write any Python for this.  I just copied over the old drawing system from the last iteration of this project and called it via direct command line arguments.  If you are the only one who will probably ever read this, have a better idea, and want to make a pull request and/or suggestion, go for it.
